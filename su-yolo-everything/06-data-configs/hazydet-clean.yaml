# HazyDet — Clean (non-hazy) source images for baseline comparison
# https://github.com/GrokCV/HazyDet
# 3 classes, COCO annotations converted to YOLO format
#
# Uses clean_images (original undegraded images) for training.
# Test sets are still hazy to measure domain gap between clean-trained
# and haze-trained models.
#
# Reference baselines (from paper Table 5, trained on clean, tested on hazy):
#   Faster RCNN:  mAP 39.5% (synth hazy test), 21.5% (real hazy test)
#   + RIDCP dehaze: mAP 44.8% (synth hazy test), 24.2% (real hazy test)
