# HazyDet — Hazy (degraded) images variant
# Train on hazy/foggy images instead of clean images
# Uses symlinked directories: hazy_train/images -> ../train/hazy_images, etc.
# Labels are also symlinked:  hazy_train/labels -> ../train/labels
#
# Run tools/setup_hazy_symlinks.py first to create the symlink structure.
