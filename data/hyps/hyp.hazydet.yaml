# Hyperparameters tuned for HazyDet drone-view object detection in hazy conditions
# Based on hyp.visdrone.yaml with haze-specific adjustments informed by
# "HazyDet: Open-Source Benchmark for Drone-View Object Detection with Depth-Cues in Hazy Scenes"
#
# Key differences from visdrone:
#   - hsv_s: 0.4 (reduced — haze already desaturates; strong saturation jitter can break haze realism)
#   - hsv_v: 0.6 (increased — haze varies brightness heavily, model must be robust to contrast shifts)
#   - scale: 0.7 (more aggressive — HazyDet has extreme scale variation, 64–1024 px^2 objects)
#   - mosaic: 0.7 (moderate — denser than VisDrone but haze context matters; too much mosaic fragments haze gradients)
#   - mixup: 0.10 (slightly more than visdrone — helps with haze-induced feature shift, but not so much it blurs small objects)
#   - translate: 0.2 (same as visdrone — objects are scattered non-uniformly in drone scenes)
#   - flipud: 0.5 (drone perspective benefits from vertical flip)
#   - copy_paste: 0.0 (HazyDet has bbox-only annotations, no segmentation masks)
#   - fl_gamma: 1.5 (focal loss — HazyDet is heavily car-dominated, focal loss helps truck/bus recall)
#   - cls: 1.0 (doubled — class imbalance in HazyDet is severe: car ~85%, truck ~8%, bus ~7%)
#   - inner_iou_ratio: 0.7 (helps small object bbox regression, majority of HazyDet objects are small)
